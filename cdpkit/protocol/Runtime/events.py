"""
This file is generated by generator/run.py based on the Chrome DevTools Protocol.

Runtime domain exposes JavaScript runtime by means of remote evaluation and mirror objects.
Evaluation results are returned as mirror object that expose object type, string representation
and unique identifier that can be used for further object reference. Original objects are
maintained in memory unless they are either explicitly released or are released along with the
other objects in their object group.
